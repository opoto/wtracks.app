    <table><tr>
      <td><img src="../img/warning.png" alt="!! WARNING !!"></td>
      <td>This site is not a professional one. It offers a free service hoping it may be useful for you. It does not offer any guaranty about the information it provides. It does not guarantee neither the confidentiality of information you enter on it (note that when you log in, your password is NOT sent to this site). In particular, be aware that when you save a track on this server may be seen by other users of this site. Notice that saving tracks on this server is not mandatory: you may edit tracks without saving them, or save them elsewhere.</td>
    </tr></table>

    <p>Login feature of wtracks is only provided to help in managing your tracks. We rely on <a href="http://openid.net"><img src="http://wiki.openid.net/f/openid-16x16.gif" alt="" border=0><b>OpenID</b></a> for the sole purpose of simplifying the login process: you don't need to create an account on our site and memorize another useless password. Even if you're not aware of it, you probably already have an OpenID: you automatically got one if you have an account on Google, Yahoo, AOL, Flickr, Blogger, and <a href="http://openid.net/get/">many many more</a>. <b>You only need to login if you want to save your tracks on this server.</b></p>
    <p>The sole data we request from your OpenID account are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Nickname</b>: Displayed on the web site to show you are logged in, and give you a hint of the account you used for it.</li>
        <li><b>Identifier</b>: This is your unique identifier that we associate to the <b>tracks you decide to save on this server</b>.</li>
    </ul>
